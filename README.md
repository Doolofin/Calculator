# Calculator
Description
The Calculator App is an Android application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic 
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It also 
supports changing the sign of numbers (positive/negative) and decimal point input. The app 
evaluates mathematical expressions and displays the result to the user.

## Functionality
The following required functionality is completed:

 User sees a user-friendly calculator interface.
 User can input digits (0-9) by tapping on buttons.
 User can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
 User can clear the input and start over.
 User can change the sign of a number from positive to negative or vice versa.
 User can input a decimal point for floating-point numbers.

 The following extensions are implemented:

 User can see a history of previous calculations.
 User can use parentheses for more complex calculations.
 User can customize the calculator theme (e.g., light mode, dark mode).
 User can copy the result to the clipboard.
 User can use advanced functions like square root, exponentiation, etc.
This is a basic outline of the project description and functionality. You can expand on the 
extensions as needed, and if you have any specific questions or need further assistance
with any aspect of your project, feel free to ask.
